"""Integration provider ports — abstractions core code uses to fetch
remote integration configuration without depending on a specific
SaaS backend.

Today the only port is :func:`fetch_remote_integrations`, called by
:mod:`app.core.orchestration.node.resolve_integrations.node` to pull the user's
org-wide integrations from a remote source. The default returns an
empty list; the CLI/SDK boundary registers a Tracer-Cloud-backed
fetcher via :func:`set_remote_integrations_fetcher`. Headless
contexts (tests, scripted invocations, alternate hosting) get the
empty default and fall through to local-store integration sources.

Same Ports & Adapters pattern as
``app.core.orchestration.node.publish_findings.upstream_correlation`` and
``app/observability``: core
depends on abstractions, vendor SDKs plug in as adapters at the
boundary.
